      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <br /><br />
      <p>I have a deep passion for travel photography, using my journeys as inspiration to create compelling visual content. Alongside photography, I find joy in expressing creativity through pencil sketches, infusing detail and imagination into my artwork. One of my biggest aspirations is to climb Mt. K2, fueled by a sense of adventure and a determination to conquer challenging goals. These interests reflect my adventurous spirit, creative mindset, and dedication to personal growth and achievement.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid sports enthusiast and a three-time Maharashtra state Gold medalist in Karate. Competing in the National Games thrice has taught me perseverance, focus, and disciplineâ€”qualities I bring to all areas of my life and work.</p>
